        <h3>(Left) Games We Fuck With Right Now</br> (Below) How The Boys Came To Be</h3>
        <p>Jake, Isaac, Dom, Nik, and Alex all lived in the same neighborhood since they were very young.
             They all quickly became friends through thier shared love of Nerf guns, outdoor sports, 
             Legos and most of all videogames.They started out playing mostly Halo and COD on Xbox but towards Highscool days they switched to PC. 
             Shortly after Jake met Reed along with a few other friends: Kody, Nick, and Cody who did already or would eventually
              play on PC as well, 
             and Reed introduced the group to even more people, namely Cameron.</p>
        <p>We quickly had many people in our discord server and continued to play many types of games. 
            We all have our own favorite types of games we play by ourselves 
            but we also play many games together across many different genres.</p>
        <p>Were always looking for more people to join us to play different types of games 
            and how it can influence us to try new things.</p>
